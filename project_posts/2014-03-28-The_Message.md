After decided I needed a moon, ( creating an eclipse - as otherwise the light cast on the planet would be factually innacurate as the cities are portrayed during the dark hours), I moved back onto the presentation of the data.
I was aware that it was important to convey the information flowing through the Bitcoin Blockchain in a simple manner, for the art must communicate with all walks of life. 
I opted to keep text and figures off the page.  
Instead, in the same manner that the location, and time of a transaction is expressed as a node placed on the planet, 
I incorporated the amount of Bitcoins being processed.  I did this in 3 ways.  
First the amount of bitcoins is reflected in the size of the node which appears.  
Then, to help differentiate between similar amount sizes, I also added a hue parser which will apply a different color to nodes in accordance with the amount processed. 
Finally a sound is played.  The higher the amount of Bitcoins transacted, the higher the pitch.   This adds a further dimension to the piece which I hope keeps it subtle and captivating.
