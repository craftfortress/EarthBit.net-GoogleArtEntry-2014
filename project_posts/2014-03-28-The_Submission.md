I cleaned up the code, rehosted the images so they are on github and removed the last of the text.

I am happy I fixed the problems and have achieved my vision. 

##Future Improvements
One always wants to do more, I wish to expand this project by complementing it with a piece of media. The idea is to create the first ever time lapse of every single Bitcon transaction that has occurred. 

Now earthBit has been built, this will be an easy task.  All I have to do is plug in the data and record it.  However I do need a database dump from the Blockchain.info, due to their daily 18,000 request limit on their API.  The goods news is I am in talks to receive this.  I estimate it will take around 3 days to complete it.

I hope my submission is enjoyed and appreciated.  Thank you for putting on this competition and for the subsequent exhibition which I am looking forward to seeing.  Fingers crossed I will one day work for the Google Data Arts team!
