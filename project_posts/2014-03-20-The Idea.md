There is no easy way to understand how far reaching the worlds first major cryptocurrency has become.  I am to solve this using open source tools and a little magic.
My dream is to work for the Google Data Arts Visualisation team.  Being familiar with their work I aim to use the excellent WebGL-globe.

I will hook this up to the Blockchain.info API, which will provide real-time transactions which occur over the Bitcoin network.

I will then work on updating the code to provide a perfect representation of the data I need.  It should clearly display location of the nearest node for the transaction and Bitcoin amount, without cluttering up the landscape.
The final product should be a beautiful representation of the worlds Bitcoin network transactions in real-time, which will help get me the job I have always wanted.
