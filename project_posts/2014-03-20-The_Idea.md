There is no easy way to understand how far reaching the worlds first major cryptocurrency has become.  I am to solve this using open source tools and a little magic.

My dream is to work for the Google Data Arts Visualisation team.  Being familiar with their work I  already started work on Earthbit, using their webgl-globe as a perfect base.

I haved hooked this up to the Blockchain.info API, which provides real-time transactions which occur over the Bitcoin network.

However, it remains unfinished & broken.  I will work on updating the code to provide a functional and perfect representation of the data I need.  It should clearly display location of the nearest node for the transaction and Bitcoin amount, without cluttering up the landscape.


The final product will be a beautiful representation of the worlds Bitcoin network transactions in real-time.
